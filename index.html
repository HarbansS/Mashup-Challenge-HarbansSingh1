<h1>My Pets</h1><!--the title (biggest heading)-->
    
<b>I have three different pets, and they are all my favorite for different reasons. I feed them and give them water every day, and even though it's a lot of work, they are totally worth it.</b><!--a introduction sentence on what this will be about-->
    
<h2>Lula</h2><!--h2 is for the animals names-->
    <img src="Puppy.jpg" alt="Lula the puppy"><!--picture of the animal that is given-->
<h3>Dog</h3><!--h3 is for the animals species-->

<p>Lula's been my dog for two years, and she's really fun to play with.  I like to take her to the park.  Her favorite toy is an old tennis ball.</p><!--the description given on each pet-->
    <!--the comments written from line 14 to 18 are repeated for the next 2 times-->
<h2>Slowpoke</h2>
  <img src="Turtle.jpg" alt="Slowpoke the turtle">
<h3>Turtle</h3>

<p>Slowpoke is my turtle.  I have had him for as long as I can remember, but he became mine for real when I turned 10 because I promised to take care of him.</p>

<h2>Hamster</h2>
    <img src="Fish.jpg" alt="hamster the fish">
<h3>Fish</h3>

<p>Hamster is the name of my fish.  I named him hamster because I wanted a hamster and not a fish, but I like him anyway.  He basically just swims around all day, but I still like him.</p>
